                <p>In my free time I enjoy playing video games with my family and friends. Some of my favorite game series are Fallout, Resident Evil, and Borderlands. I also love to program my own video games using the Unreal Engine.</p>

                <p>One of my favorite aspects of programing is robotics. I have build the robot pictured, drones, and even a robot with a completely Lego body. Robotics is the perfect meshing of my love of hands on activity and my love for programming.</p>

                <p>Well before I discovered programming my dream was to become a comic book writer, I even went as far as majoring in creative writing initially. My love for comics has been one I've had since childhood and have no intention of ever leaving it behind.</p>

                <p>One of my favorite parts of the day is getting to spend time with my Wife. We both love anime and after a long day at work or school we both love to just sit on the couch and watch anime together. It was one of our favorite things while dating and continues to be one of our favorite ways to spend time with one another.</p>
