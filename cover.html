            <h3>My Intended Major:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Bachelors Degree in Computer Science (Application and Database Development)</li>
                <li>2023 Projected Graduation</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Experience Summary:</h3>
            <p>I have been working on development professionally for seven years currently. I have worked on development
                at Bitwise Industries, Shift3 Technology and Pressed Juicery; all of which I did website development and
                database development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, SQL, MongoDB) I have also taught programming
                for Geekwise Academy, 59 Day of Code, and InnovEd; at all of these I taught Robotics, Game Design,
                Website Development, Application Development, and Introduction To AI (C++, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                Python). I have also spent time working as an independent contractor for a variety of different firms
                working as a consultant of different projects.</p>
            <h3>My Perceived Calling:</h3>
            <p>I believe that my calling is to make the world a better place. I feel that God has called me to work in
                technology so that I can make advancements in technology and make the world a better and safer place. I
                know that the technology sector is the right one for me because the second I started in it I never could
                imagine doing anything else. I also hope to one day continue to share my knowledge and love of technology
                with the next generation so that they can make the world even better and I can show them how God has gifted
                them with such a great talent.</p>
